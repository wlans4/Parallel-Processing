The performance is similar between openMP and MPI. I would assume this is beause the problem is small enough that any difference between the two that would matter is mitigated. If the problem was quite large, I think that MPI would outperform OpenMP when written correctly, as it can be tailored to each situation more efficiently. OpenMP is all about making the process easy, not necessarily the most efficient.
